Computer Programming

machine language is a collection of binary
digits or bits

that the computer reads and interprets.
Machine language is the only language a
computer is capable of understanding.

The exact machine language for a program or
action can differ by operating system.
The specific operating system dictates how a
compiler writes a program or action into
machine language.

Computer programs are written in one or
more programming languages, like C++, Java,
or Visual Basic. A computer cannot directly
understand the programming languages used to
create computer programs, so the program
code must be compiled. Once a program's code
is compiled, the computer can understand it
because the program's code is turned into
machine language.
